# Team Children of Jupyter Final Project
Group 1 Final Project: Data Analytics Boot Camp

## Selected Topic and Rationale
We will be using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Our team selected this topic because we wanted to obtain a deeper understanding of the tragedy and how different passenger attributes impacted their odds of survival.
## Data Source
Our resources will come from the dataset contained in the ["stablelearner" r-package](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/DALEX/html/titanic.html#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20website%201317,for%20a%20few%20regular%20passengers.) and stored as [CSV files](Resources/titanic.csv).

## Technologies Used
We are tentatively planning to use a [decision tree model](Notebooks/Titanic-decision-tree.ipynb). For our database we will utilize pgAdmin and store [a backup file](Resources/titanic_project_db_backup.sql) of the database that project members can download and restore on their local machines. For an interactive dashboard, we want to use JavaScript.

## Questions We Hope to Answer
We will run statistical analysis to see how different groups faired based on factors such as age, gender, socio-economic status, etc. We are hoping to add a section of our dashboard that allows users to input their own information and generate their probability of survival.

## Communication Protocols
We plan to work asynchronously and use class times to go over what each member is working on, including walkthroughs of how tasks were completed. We will be communicating through slack and using Saturday morning sessions to troubleshoot on an as-needed basis.

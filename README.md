Group 1 Final Project: Data Analytics Boot Camp

We will be using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Our resources will come from Kaggle in the form of CSV files. We are tentatively planning to use a random forest machine learning model. For our database we will utilize pgAdmin. For an interactive dashboard, we want to use JavaScript.
We will run statistical analysis to see how different groups faired based on factors such as age, gender, socio-economic status, etc. We are hopping to add a section of our dashboard that allows users to input their own information and generate their probability of survival.
We plan to work asynchronously and use class times to go over what each member is working on, including walkthroughs of how tasks were completed. We will be communicating through slack and using Saturday morning sessions to troubleshoot on an as-needed basis.

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our resources will come from Kaggle in the form of CSV files.

## Database Storage
pgAdmin is going to act as our primary database management, with Javascript acting as an interactive dashboard.

## Machine Learning
We'll be using a decision tree machine learning model with mlenv to run statistical analysis to see how different groups fared based on factors such as age, gender, socio-economic status, etc. We are hoping to add a section of our dashboard that allows users to input their own information and generate their probability of survival based on the predictions of the machine learning model.

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
